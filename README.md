## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a privacy-focused local search engine for efficiently finding files on your laptop. This includes images (photos), videos, documents (PDFs, DOCx, PPTs, etc.), and audio files.

### Supported File Types
1. Images (Photos)
2. Videos
3. Documents (PDFs, DOCx, PPTs, etc.)
4. Audio files

## Core Features
Automatic Indexing: New files are automatically indexed upon upload for quick retrieval.
Keyword Search: Search for files using keywords in their names or metadata.
Semantic Search: Leverage AI to understand file content and deliver more relevant results.
Image Search: Find similar images by uploading a reference image.

## Technology Stack
Image Similarity Search: OpenCLIP
Video Analysis: Video CLIP models or alternative solutions.
Document Understanding: BERT, OpenAI
Audio Analysis: to do

## Benefits
Efficiency: Quickly find the files you need, even with large amounts of data.
Privacy Focus: Maintain complete control over your data. All processing occurs locally on the userâ€™s laptop. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring complete privacy.
Advanced Search: Go beyond simple keyword searches and find files based on their content.
Versatility: Search across various file types, including images, videos, documents, and audio.

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline involves loading local files, embedding all the files, and putting them into the vector database.

## Modeling Approach
The modeling approach involves calculating similarity scores between query and files embeddings.

## Model Evaluation Approach
The model evaluation approach will be detailed in the upcoming sections.

## Previous Approaches and Novelty
This project is novel in its local, open-sourced, and LLM-powered-recommendation approach. Previous approaches and their comparison will be detailed in the upcoming sections.

## Performance Analysis
The performance of the model will be analyzed relative to previous approaches. The similarity calculation metric will be detailed in the upcoming sections.

## Deep Learning vs Non-Deep Learning Approach
The deep learning approach involves using embedding models. The non-deep learning approach involves using TFIDF (only for text).

## Comparison to a Naive Approach
The naive approach involves a keyword search without embeddings of files. The comparison will be detailed in the upcoming sections.
